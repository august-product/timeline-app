This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

Step 2: Get the Project from GitHub

Open this link in your browser:
👉 https://github.com/august-product/timeline-app

Click the green “Code” button → then click “Download ZIP”.

Once downloaded, unzip the file (right-click → “Extract All” on Windows or double-click on Mac).

You should now have a folder called timeline-app on your computer.

🪄 Step 3: Open the Project in VS Code

Open VS Code.

Go to File → Open Folder...

Select the timeline-app folder you just unzipped.

Wait for a few seconds — you’ll see all the project files appear on the left side.

🪄 Step 4: Open the Terminal Inside VS Code

In the top menu, click: View → Terminal.

A panel will open at the bottom — that’s your terminal.
(It’s like a command window built right into VS Code!)

🪄 Step 5: Install Everything the App Needs

In that terminal, type this and press Enter:

npm install


🕐 It might take a minute or two — this is normal.
It’s downloading all the small libraries the project needs.

🪄 Step 6: Run the App

After that finishes, type this and press Enter:

npm run dev


✅ You’ll see something like:

Local: http://localhost:3000/

🪄 Step 7: Open the App

Hold Ctrl (or Cmd on Mac) and click that link —
it’ll open in your browser automatically.

You’ll now see the Timeline App running locally on your computer 🎉

🪄 Step 8: Stop the App (when done)

To stop it, click on the terminal area and press Ctrl + C (or Cmd + C on Mac).

🪄 That’s It!

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
